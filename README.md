***TAG RE-DISCOVERED***

Game starts off with a welcome screen. To progress, press navigation button in.
A countdown from 3 will start before revealing the game screen.

The aim of the game is to use the navigation switch to direct the player
(starting at the centre) to the enemy cursors and 'tag' them. Each tag increases
the players score by 5, increases the amount of game time left (by 1 second)
and makes the tagged enemy respawn at a different, unoccupied location. The
game always has two enemies active at any time (Enemy numbers can be easily
changed in the code). The game starts with 10 seconds on the clock.
Every 2 seconds the enemies respawn at a new location.

After running out of time (due to not catching enough enemies) the game over
screen will appear and display your score. The game can be restarted by
pressing the navigation switch in.
